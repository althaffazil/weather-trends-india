# 🌦️ Weather Trends in Indian Cities (2020–2024)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **seasonal weather trends across five major Indian cities** (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, and Kolkata) using the **Open-Meteo API** and Python.  
The study covers the period **2020–2024**, focusing on **temperature patterns and rainfall distribution** across summer, winter, and monsoon seasons.  

The goal is to extract **data-driven insights** about regional climate variations and present them through **clear, compelling visualizations**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect and process historical weather data (2020–2024) using the **Open-Meteo API**.  
- Explore **seasonal variations** in maximum and minimum temperatures across cities.  
- Analyze **rainfall distribution during monsoons** and its impact across regions.  
- Build **visualizations** (bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, heatmaps) to communicate findings.  
- Summarize key insights and provide actionable conclusions.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Open-Meteo API** (Historical Weather Data)  
- **Google Colab** (Code, Analysis & Documentation)  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Delhi** recorded the **lowest winter minimums** (below 10 °C), showing vulnerability to cold waves.  
- **Chennai** remained consistently **warmest in winter** (above 22 °C), reflecting its tropical climate.  
- **Mumbai and Bangalore** showed **moderate variations**, while **Kolkata** recorded slightly cooler winters.  
- **Monsoon rainfall** peaked in Mumbai and Kolkata, highlighting their **flood-prone conditions**.  
- Rising **maximum summer temperatures** across years suggest **increasing heatwave risks**.

## 📌 Limitations
- Covers only **five metro cities**; not representative of entire India.  
- Data limited to **2020–2024**; longer timelines would give stronger climate trends.  
- Extreme weather events may be **smoothed out in averages**.  

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Extend dataset to **10–20 years** for long-term climate trend analysis.  
- Include **Tier-2 & Tier-3 cities** for broader coverage.  
- Add more parameters like **humidity, wind speed, and air quality**.  
- Explore **climate forecasting** using statistical or machine learning models.  
- Link weather data with **energy, agriculture, or health outcomes** for applied insights.
